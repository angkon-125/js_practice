// loop in js
// for loop
for (let i = 0; i < 100; i++){
    console.log(i);
 let wored = "fuck you mather fucker"
 console.log(wored)
}

// this is example of for loop
// for loop is used to iterate over a block of code a number of times
// for loop has three parts
// 1. initialization - this is where you declare the loop variable
// 2. condition - this is where you specify the condition that must be true for the loop to continue

// while loop 
let j = 0 ;
while (j < 10) {
    console.log(j);
    j++;
}

// Next example of while loop 


let y = 0 ;
while (y < 99) {
    console.log(y);
    y++;
}

//next loop is do while loop 

let number = 40;
let i = 100;
 do{
    
 }while(i)
